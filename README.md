## About Me
I am a Product Manager at [Screenly](https://www.screenly.io/), working on building reliable, secure, and easy-to-use digital signage software.

Alongside my work at Screenly, I am building [Screenlite](https://github.com/screenlite), an open-source digital signage ecosystem that includes a CMS, player applications, and remote device management.

I’m deeply involved in the digital signage industry: a moderator of [r/digitalsignage](https://reddit.com/r/digitalsignage) and the curator of [Signagelist](https://github.com/Screenly/signagelist), the largest directory of digital signage software, and I write digital signage–related posts on my blog at [514sid.com](https://514sid.com).

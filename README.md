## About Me
I am building [Screenlite](https://github.com/screenlite), an open-source digital signage ecosystem including CMS, player apps, and remote device management for digital signage.  

I am deeply involved in the digital signage industry, a moderator of [r/digitalsignage](https://reddit.com/r/digitalsignage), and curator of one of the largest directories of digital signage software, [SignageList](https://github.com/514sid/digital-signage-list).
